 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

 Installation

To set up the project, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:


npm install react@19.0.0 react-dom@19.0.0 react-icons@5.5.0 react-router-dom@7.2.0 react-scripts@5.0.1 webpack-dev-server@5.2.0 bcrypt@5.1.1 bcryptjs@3.0.2 jsonwebtoken@9.0.2 mongoose@8.11.0 axios@1.8.1 cloudinary@2.6.0 cors@2.8.5 dotenv@16.4.7 multer@1.4.5-lts.1 @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object@7.21.11

 Available Scripts

 To Run the Server:

Navigate to the backend directory and start the server using:


cd backend
npx nodemon app.js


To Run the Frontend:

From the root directory, start the React development server:


npm start


This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

 Other Available Scripts

 npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

 npm run build

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
React is bundled in production mode and optimized for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

npm run eject

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
